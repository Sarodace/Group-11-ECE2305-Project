In order to get this file up and running, you got to set up some environment
variables first. Since I don't want to expose sensitive information to the entire
world, I have my code reference locally stored variables which point to my acount
token and authenication token.

This'll eventually become a proper file that handles variable installation 
automatically, but this'll do for now.

LINUX:
Open your terminal and run the following command:
  export TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID="..."

After that, type in:
  export TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN="+++"

Type in:
  export SENDER_PHONE_NUMBER="@@@"

Finally, type in:
  export RECIPIENT_PHONE_NUMBER="&&&"


When you run these commands, replace ... with the Account Sid, replace +++ 
with the Auth Token, and replace @@@ with the phone number that I'll send out. 
Keep in mind that &&& can be any number that you wish to receive the message at.
This phone is in the form of the SENDER_PHONE_NUMBER that I'll send. 

Finally, you can run the program by typing in "python2.7 main.py"

Let me know if anyone has any questions!
